November helps you generate a simple Node.js API tailored for [Ember.js](http://emberjs.com) apps, with the help of [Express](http://expressjs.com) and [Sequelize](http://docs.sequelizejs.com/en/latest).


Installation
------------
```bash
$ npm install -g november-cli
```


Get started
-----------
```bash
$ november new my-app
```
This will create a new project with the following structure:
```
├── app
│   ├── actions
│   ├── controllers
│   ├── middleware
│   ├── models
│   ├── router.js
│
├── config
│   ├── config.json
│
├── lib
├── migrations
├── node_modules
├── public
├── server.js
├── test
```

By default, MySQL is used as a database, but you can use any relational database [supported by Sequelize](http://docs.sequelizejs.com/en/latest) by changing the values in `config/config.json`.

To run the app, run `npm start` (or just `nodemon` if you have it installed) in your app’s directory and visit `localhost:9000`.


In your Ember.js app
--------------------

Make sure you change the host in your Ember.js adapter file so that it can communicate with November:
```bash
# In your ember project folder
$ ember generate adapter
```
```javascript
// app/adapters/application.js
import DS from "ember-data";

export default DS.RESTAdapter.reopen({ 
  host: 'http://localhost:9000'
});
```


Models
------
```bash
$ november generate model user
```

This generates:
- A **model file** (`app/models/user.js`) for the user, which will determine the structure of the database table
- **Routes** in `app/router.js` for creating, reading, updating and deleting users (based on the conventions of Ember Data). Feel free to remove the actions you don't need.
- **Controller files**, which hook up the routes to database actions:
  - `app/controllers/user/add.js`
  - `app/controllers/user/list.js`
  - `app/controllers/user/load.js`
  - `app/controllers/user/update.js`
  - `app/controllers/user/remove.js`

With the app and your local database running in the background, visit `localhost:9000/users`, and you should see:
```json
{
  "users": []
}
```
The table `users` has automatically been created in your database.


Actions
-------
Actions are for API endpoints which are not specifically tied to any model.
```bash
$ november generate action login
```

This generates:
- An **action file** (`app/actions/login.js`)
- A **route** in `app/router.js` (`POST` by default)


Render()
-------
The `render()`-method in your controllers is used for rendering both your *models* and your *error messages*. It takes a single argument.


Rendering models
-------------
If you pass a valid sequelize model to `render()`, it will generate that model according to the [JSON API](http://jsonapi.org) conventions used by Ember Data.

The most basic usage:
```
render(<your-sequelize-model>);
```
...which can also be typed like this:
```
render({
  model: <your-sequelize-model> 
});
```
returns:
```javascript
{
  "user": {
    <...>
  }
}
```

If your sequelize model includes [associated models](http://docs.sequelizejs.com/en/latest/api/associations), they are sideloaded by default:
```javascript
{
  "user": {
    <...>
    "tweets": [1, 5]
  },
  "tweets": [
    <...>
  ]
}
```

However, you can  also opt out of sideloading, or specify if you want some (or all) associations to be embedded instead.

Here we specify that we want the tweets-association to be embedded. If we wanted *all* associations to be embedded, we would set `embedded: true`
```javascript
render({
  model: <your-sequelize-model>,
  embedded: ['tweets']
});
```
... which returns:
```javascript
{
  "user": {
    <...>
    "tweets": [
      {
        id: 1,
        <...>
      },
      {
        id: 5,
        <...>
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Rendering errors
---------------

Controllers generated by November rely heavily on promises. If they catch an error, they call `render(error)`.

Let's say we accidentally search for a field (`name`) which doesn't exist in our database table:

```javascript
// app/controllers/user/list.js
req.models.user
.findAll({
  where: {
    name: "Bob"
  }
})
.then(function(users) {
  // Not gonna happen
})
.catch(function(err) {
  render(err);
});
```

An error will be catched and `render(err)` will return this JSON to the client:
```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": 500,
    "message": "Could not load users"
  }
}
```
... while still showing a more descriptive error to the developer in the console so that you can locate the problem:

![A console error](http://tristanedwards.me/u/november/console-error.png)

You can also render your own exceptions to the user, by throwing a **string** with the error message or an **array** where the first element is the error code and the second is the error message:

```javascript
// app/controllers/user/update.js
req.models.user.find({
  where: {
    username: req.params.username
  }
})
.then(function(user) {
  if (user.id !== req.user) {
    throw [403, "You are not allowed to edit this user!"]
  }
  return user.save();
})
.then(function(user) {
  // Not gonna happen
})
.catch(function(err) {
  render(err);
});
```

...what the client will see:
```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": 403,
    "message": "You are not allowed to edit this user!"
  }
}
```

Todos
-----
TDD is not really my thing, but it would be nice to get some automatic Mocha tests when you generate new models. :)
